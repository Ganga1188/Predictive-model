# Predictive-model
Aims to predict the company bankruptcy 
The aim of this bankruptcy prediction project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model to identify and predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt. By leveraging historical financial and operational data, the model seeks to improve the institutionâ€™s risk assessment processes. This predictive capability will enable more informed lending decisions, thereby reducing exposure to high-risk loans and optimizing the financial portfolio.

Specific objectives:
Enhanced Risk Assessment: Provide an early warning system for identifying financially distressed companies, allowing timely interventions.
Informed Decision-Making: Aid in making objective lending decisions by quantifying bankruptcy risk using data-driven insights.
Portfolio Optimization: Improve portfolio quality by minimizing loans to high-risk entities and focusing resources on more stable investments.
Cost Savings and Efficiency: Streamline the decision-making process, reducing manual assessment effort and associated costs.
In summary, this project aims to reduce financial losses and enhance portfolio management through predictive modeling, ultimately helping the institution better allocate resources and mitigate risk.
